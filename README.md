# Release notes MMODA 23.12.0000

## What is MMODA

The Multi-Messenger Online analysis is an [open-source](https://github.com/oda-hub) **cloud-native platform** to derive **high-level scientific products for several astrophysical instruments**.
A [web-based interface](https://www.astro.unige.ch/mmoda/) and a [python API](https://oda-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorial_main.html) allow the users to run easily the underlying services, which run complex pipelines in a computer cluster based at the University of Geneva. These pipelines have been developed by experts in the data analysis and exploit proximity to the data combined with state-of-the-art calibration and software.
