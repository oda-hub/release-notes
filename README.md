# Release notes MMODA 22.07.0000

## What is MMODA

The Multi-Messenger Online analysis is a platform to derive high-level scientific products for several instruments. The underlying services run complex pipelines in a computer cluster based at the University of Geneva and the web-based interface makes them available in a straightforward way. It is possible to exploit most capability of the platform without a login, but for extensive runs, it is necessary to login, present the project, and acknowledge the platform usage. Pipelines have been developed by experts in the data analysis and exploit proximity to the data, state-of-the-art calibration and software. In these help pages, the user will find instructions to exploit the platform from the web interface, but services can also be accessed through a python-based API.

MMODA is developed joinly by UNIGE Department of Astronomy, EPFL LASTRO Laboratory, UniParis APC, BITP Kyiv, and supported by SDSC EPFL.
