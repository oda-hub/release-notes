# Release notes MMODA 22.07.0000

## What is MMODA

The Multi-Messenger Online analysis is an **open-source platform** to derive **high-level scientific products for several instruments**. 
The underlying services run complex pipelines in a computer cluster based at the University of Geneva and the [web-based interface](http://astro.unige.ch/mmoda/) makes them available in a straightforward way. Pipelines have been developed by experts in the data analysis and exploit proximity to the data, state-of-the-art calibration and software. In these help pages, the user will find instructions to exploit the platform from the [web interface](http://astro.unige.ch/mmoda/), but services can also be accessed through a [python API](https://oda-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorial_main.html).

MMODA is developed joinly by UNIGE Department of Astronomy, EPFL LASTRO Laboratory, UniParis APC, BITP Kyiv, and supported by SDSC EPFL.
